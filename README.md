# Resource Rivals

This is the client-side code for our trading card game, Resource Rivals, a full-stack browser game for 2 players. The game is a trading card game based around buying and selling resources with the aim of getting more points than your opponent in the time allotted.

[Backend](https://github.com/Isaac-Sturtridge/trading-card-game-backend)

## Front-end technologies

The client is served using React v18.2.0. Also used in this project on the frontend are React Spring v9.7.3, React Toastify v9.1.3, React Popup v2.0.6, and socket.io-client v4.7.2. React Spring is used to provide card animations, React Toastify for in-game messages, React Popup to display instructions and the game over message, and socket.io-client to communicate with the server's socket.io.
